<p>For the last couple of years, I've not really been interested in poker.  I've gone on a long trip and spent a lot of time learning all about programming and computer science.  I've not really had a goal in mind or any focus in life.  In this time I've also started a family, which is not really an ideal time to lose one's way professionally, but hey, anything's better than grinding micro-stakes after a few years of success, right?  I just fell out of love with the game to be honest.  I haven't played a hand in over a year now.  I don't hate it, but I didn't have the love required to swallow my pride and drop down to play low stakes again after living it up for so long.  I've known people that have done it, and have massive respect for them, but I have to admit that maybe I just don't have that strength of character.  I was lucky to arrive in a time when I could get so far without it, but unfortunately now that time has passed.</p>

<p>I also haven't really been following poker news at all.  I've seen blogger contacts of mine on Facebook move on to other things, presumably fresh blood has filled their places, but I am no longer in the loop.  My only occasional link to the past has been the odd weekly news roundup from Lee Davy that pops up in my news feed from time to time.  A couple of days ago, one caught my eye: it was <a href="http://calvinayre.com/2015/12/04/poker/was-the-pokerstars-strike-a-success-yes-no-dont-know/">Lee's excellent summary of the "Player's Strike" on Pokerstars</a> last week.  It reignited a lot of thoughts I'd been having about "the poker ecosystem" before I left the game a year ago, and I think the time off in between has given me a different perspective on the changes year-on-year without bias from the news and events of the intervening months.  I even feel compelled to blog my thoughts for the first time in many years.  I hope some of you find them interesting.</p>
